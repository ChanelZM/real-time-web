# Real Time Web
## Introduction
Facebook Messenger, Snapchat, Whatsapp and all chatrooms in particular are all platforms that make use of real time web. Real time web is the future, we are all demanding instant feedback so as a Front-End Developer it's necessary to dive into real time.

In this repo I will build a real time web application using the frontend and backend knowledge I gained following classes like Performance Matters, Browser Technologies and Webapp From Scratch (I have repos for everyone of them).

## About
Concept is still building... coming to you soon.

## Goals
### Week 1
For the first week I want to set up Socket.io, npm scripts and an Express server. When everything is set I'm going to deploy the app to test if everything is working properly.

### Week 2
Coming soon

### Week 3
Coming soon
